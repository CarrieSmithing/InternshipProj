AUTHORS: Carrie Smithing
USER INSTRUCTIONS: 

This project was made with blueJ so I made it work by adding libraries to the preferences. 
If you open it in BlueJ you will need to do the same, add the libraries json_simple-1.1 and opencsv-4.5 in preferences. 
If you compile the program in another IDE you will need to included those libraries in your class path.


The program will ask you for a file name you want the CSV printed to, if you wish to use your own file add it to the program's folder, if not there is a file already in the program that is blank you can use - Csv.txt.
After the program is finished it will tell you to open the file you chose.
